# Chapter Three: sudo — The Highest Command to the Kernel

The House-of-the-Self metaphor is illuminating: it turns the abstract notion of psychological boundaries into the concrete layout of a physical space.

Whenever different privilege levels come up, I inevitably think of the computer-science concepts of _virtualization and privilege management_. These mechanisms let users run programs on a shared system while shielding the kernel from intrusion.

I proposed to the AI an entirely new analogical framework—one I know far better. I asked it to abandon the "house" metaphor and use this model to re-examine our problem.

- **Ordinary services (e.g., manual labor, massage):** define them as programs executed inside a **“virtual environment (venv)”**. This environment is isolated, sandboxed, and restricted to its allotted resources; it can never touch the operating system's kernel.
- **Sexual services:** define them as granting the other party temporary, system-wide **“Root Access”**—that is, the power to run `sudo`.

The AI immediately grasped the model's potential. It conceded that this analogy is more precise than the House-of-the-Self because it describes not only "space" but also "privilege" and "risk."

Hence our original question about the reasonableness of the transaction is completely recast as a new, purely technical one:

#### **Would a system administrator rent out her server's Root privileges?**

In IT, any sane engineer will tell you that this is a crazy, unworkable business model. The problem is not the act of "renting" per se, but the object being rented—Root privileges—and the incalculable, catastrophic risks they carry.

Under the new model, the AI's argument decomposes into three clear, cold technical dimensions.

**1. Total collapse of security isolation**

- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** the client runs code in a sandbox. No matter what he does, a sturdy firewall protects the kernel. A house painter working in your home cannot read the files on your hard drive.
- **Root privileges (sexual services):** granting Root lets the client bypass every firewall and access, modify, or delete any system file. Isolation vanishes. He not only enters your bedroom; he can rewrite the diary on your nightstand.

**2. Devastating risks to system stability**

- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** if the client crashes his own program, at worst his service goes down; the operating system itself never crashes.
- **Root privileges (sexual services):** a root-level user, even through innocent error, can easily trigger a Kernel Panic—the system crash. This maps perfectly onto the PTSD we discussed earlier: one violent or humiliating episode can hit the psychological kernel with crash-level force. Such damage is not fixed by a simple reboot.

**3. Exposure and pollution of core data**

- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** the client cannot read the system's core data.
- **Root privileges (sexual services):** this is the most terrifying part. The client can not only **read** all your data—memories, feelings, dignity—but he can also **write** data. He can install trojans, viruses, or leave behind a barely detectable backdoor (**rootkit**).

  This precisely explains how traumatic memory works. At your most vulnerable moment, the client implants an experience filled with shame or pain. That piece of malicious code then lies dormant, and one day, when you try to form intimacy with someone who genuinely loves you, it suddenly executes, disrupting and sabotaging your ability to trust and feel pleasure.

By now, the answer is self-evident.

#### **Can Rent Cover the Risk?**

Let us view the "rental" strictly as a business deal. A client rents your Root privileges for an hour and pays you 100 yuan. During that hour he crashes your system, deletes your data permanently, and plants a backdoor that will siphon off every future bit of information you create.

Can that 100-yuan "rent" possibly cover such catastrophic—and potentially permanent—losses? Obviously not.

**The power of this model is that it frees us from the swamp of morality. We are no longer debating good versus evil; we are weighing cost against risk.**

But I realized a fundamental premise still had to be proved. I therefore put a deeper challenge to the AI:

> “This analogy is compelling, but what is its foundation? You have to show me **why sex is the `sudo` command rather than just another ordinary `venv`.**”

The AI’s reply pulled our discussion out of casual metaphor and straight into the hard facts of biology and psychology. From three independent angles, it sought to pin down an incontestable truth.


#### **Biochemical proof: non-skippable hardware interrupts and kernel-level commands**

Our body-plus-brain is a piece of hardware running its own operating system. In this system, sexual activity can fire off low-level instructions that no virtual environment ever has permission to call.

- **A pathway that cannot be virtualised — the vagus nerve：** The vagus nerve, one of the longest cranial nerves, is a high-speed bus linking the brain to the internal organs, genitals included. The intense stimulus of orgasm travels along this nerve as an unmaskable, top-priority **hardware interrupt**. Heart rate shifts, breathing momentarily stops, muscles release, pupils dilate. Such direct action on hardware (the body) and on the kernel (brain-stem and limbic system) is far beyond any ordinary service. Finishing a coding task never triggers a physiological reboot; orgasm can.

- **Forced rewrite of global variables — the hormone storm：** Oxytocin, vasopressin and their companions are not ordinary “program output”; they are the operating system’s **global environment variables**. Oxytocin rewires our baseline model of trust and attachment, as if a process had obtained root and rewritten the firewall rules and user-trust list. Prolactin, arriving next, issues a **forced sleep** command. Ordinary job satisfaction might add +1 to a local variable, but it has no authority to touch the global settings that govern how we bond with others.

Biochemically, then, sex can trigger hardware interrupts and rewrite system-wide variables that determine our core physiological and emotional state. **This is the physical basis of its root privilege.**

#### **Psychological proof: the inseparable self-and-body**

Here lies the heart of the sudo analogy. Why does selling sex harm the self so differently from selling labour?

The theory of **embodied cognition** in modern psychology and philosophy tells us that the “self” is not a free-floating soul: it is knitted into the body, which is both the vessel and the boundary of who we are.

To keep that from remaining abstract, let us look directly at lived experience.


#### **Thought experiment: two rentals**
 
Imagine you can lease either of two assets for one hour:

- **Asset A:** a car you own.  
- **Asset B:** your body, for sexual services.
     
 
Put the same rude, inconsiderate—perhaps even sadistic—client in both scenarios.
 
**Renting your car (ordinary labour / external asset)**  
He drives recklessly, shreds the tyres, trashes the interior. When you get the car back you feel angry and annoyed. Your emotions point **outward**—toward the object (the car) and the person (the renter). You are unlikely to question your worth as a human being. Car is car; you are you. The self stays largely intact.
 
**Renting your body (sex work):**  
The same client now “rents” your body. He performs rough sex, hurls insults, ignores your feelings. An hour later he pays and leaves.

What do you feel?

Almost certainly not merely, “My body was over-used.” The body that was injured and humiliated **is you**. You cannot dissociate from it the way you dissociate from a car.

Hence the emotions turn **inward**:

–  **Shame:** “How could I let this happen to me?”  
–  **Devalued self-worth:** “Am I really that cheap? Is this all I’m worth?”  
–  **A sense of contamination:** “I feel dirty, and it won’t wash off.”  
–  **Boundary collapse:** “My most private territory was invaded and trampled by someone I despise.”

In the first scenario damage lands on a thing; in the second it pierces straight to the **self**. It attacks self-esteem, purity, safety, the basic sense of human value.

That is why sex carries root privileges: when violated, what gets corrupted is not a peripheral device or an application, but the operating-system kernel—our deepest convictions about who we are and how we deserve to be treated.

Ordinary labour sells results that are **outside** the body; sexual transactions sell permission that is **inside** the body. Because mind and body are inseparable, the latter inevitably drags the self into the deal. **This is the psychological basis of its root privilege.**

#### **Sociological proof: the super-key to core relationships**

Within the human social graph, sex wields a unique power to define—or detonate—the deepest links.。

- **Creating exclusive bonds：** Sex is the prime **relationship-state converter**, upgrading “friend” directly to “lover,” a tie that demands exclusivity and high intensity.

- **Blowing up core trust:** Conversely, sex is the most potent weapon for destroying the core. **Infidelity** wounds far more deeply than most betrayals because your partner entrusted you with the key to their root privileges; you then handed it to someone else. That is treachery at the lowest layer.

Every sexual act performs read-write operations on your most central relationships. **This is the sociological basis of its root privilege.**

By now every premise of the model is corroborated. It is no longer just a metaphor but a fact triangulated by neuroscience, psychology and sociology:

- At the hardware layer, it can directly engage your physiological kernel;
- At the software layer, it rewrites personality and self-concept;  
- At the network layer, it sets—or shatters—the links that structure your closest relationships.

At last we possess a language precise enough to chart emotions and relationships that once felt indistinct.

Yet even the most elegant model must face stress tests. New questions arise:

If ordinary work is confined to a `venv`, why do some people still find their real lives and health devastated by work—say, long-term verbal abuse from a boss that leads to PTSD? Why do some employees, on losing a job, choose to end their own lives?
