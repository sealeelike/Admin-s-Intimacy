raw_string = """ **Chapter Three: sudo — The Highest Command to the Kernel**\n\nThe House-of-the-Self metaphor is illuminating: it turns the abstract notion of psychological boundaries into the concrete layout of a physical space.\n\nWhenever different privilege levels come up, I inevitably think of the computer-science concepts of _virtualization and privilege management_. These mechanisms let users run programs on a shared system while shielding the kernel from intrusion.\n\nI proposed to the AI an entirely new analogical framework—one I know far better. I asked it to abandon the \"house\" metaphor and use this model to re-examine our problem.\n\n- **Ordinary services (e.g., manual labor, massage):** define them as programs executed inside a **“virtual environment (venv)”**. This environment is isolated, sandboxed, and restricted to its allotted resources; it can never touch the operating system's kernel.\n- **Sexual services:** define them as granting the other party temporary, system-wide **“Root Access”**—that is, the power to run `sudo`.\n\nThe AI immediately grasped the model's potential. It conceded that this analogy is more precise than the House-of-the-Self because it describes not only \"space\" but also \"privilege\" and \"risk.\"\n\n---\n\nHence our original question about the reasonableness of the transaction is completely recast as a new, purely technical one:\n\n#### **Would a system administrator rent out her server's Root privileges?**\n\nIn IT, any sane engineer will tell you that this is a crazy, unworkable business model. The problem is not the act of \"renting\" per se, but the object being rented—Root privileges—and the incalculable, catastrophic risks they carry.\n\nUnder the new model, the AI's argument decomposes into three clear, cold technical dimensions.\n\n**1. Total collapse of security isolation**\n\n- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** the client runs code in a sandbox. No matter what he does, a sturdy firewall protects the kernel. A house painter working in your home cannot read the files on your hard drive.\n- **Root privileges (sexual services):** granting Root lets the client bypass every firewall and access, modify, or delete any system file. Isolation vanishes. He not only enters your bedroom; he can rewrite the diary on your nightstand.\n\n**2. Devastating risks to system stability**\n\n- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** if the client crashes his own program, at worst his service goes down; the operating system itself never crashes.\n- **Root privileges (sexual services):** a root-level user, even through innocent error, can easily trigger a Kernel Panic—the system crash. This maps perfectly onto the PTSD we discussed earlier: one violent or humiliating episode can hit the psychological kernel with crash-level force. Such damage is not fixed by a simple reboot.\n\n**3. Exposure and pollution of core data**\n\n- **Virtual environment (ordinary services):** the client cannot read the system's core data.\n- **Root privileges (sexual services):** this is the most terrifying part. The client can not only **read** all your data—memories, feelings, dignity—but he can also **write** data. He can install trojans, viruses, or leave behind a barely detectable backdoor (**rootkit**).\n\n  This precisely explains how traumatic memory works. At your most vulnerable moment, the client implants an experience filled with shame or pain. That piece of malicious code then lies dormant, and one day, when you try to form intimacy with someone who genuinely loves you, it suddenly executes, disrupting and sabotaging your ability to trust and feel pleasure.\n\nBy now, the answer is self-evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Can Rent Cover the Risk?**\n\nLet us view the \"rental\" strictly as a business deal. A client rents your Root privileges for an hour and pays you 100 yuan. During that hour he crashes your system, deletes your data permanently, and plants a backdoor that will siphon off every future bit of information you create.\n\nCan that 100-yuan \"rent\" possibly cover such catastrophic—and potentially permanent—losses? Obviously not.\n\n**The power of this model is that it frees us from the swamp of morality. We are no longer debating good versus evil; we are weighing cost against risk.**"""
