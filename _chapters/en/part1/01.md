# Chapter One: Prostitution – A Seemingly Reasonable Transaction?

My initial proposition was simple: for an individual without a partner yet with sexual needs, engaging in prostitution is a reasonable solution.

I submitted this view to an AI.

The AI raised objections. It accepted that my logic held merit—but argued that it was based on a narrow personal perspective—and presented its arguments from three angles.

**First, regarding the other party in the transaction.**  
The AI's point is that the “voluntary” nature of sex work is questionable. It cited data showing that this group is generally linked to poverty, drug addiction, or human trafficking, with their participation being the result of having “no other choice.” At the same time, they face an extremely high risk of PTSD.

**Second, concerning the nature of the transaction.**  
The AI introduced two concepts:

- **Objectification:** In other words, the sexual transaction reduces people to mere “objects” meant solely to satisfy desire.
- **Power Imbalance:** There is an inherent inequality between the paying and receiving parties due to the monetary exchange.

**Third, regarding the impact on the buyer.**  
The AI argued that such behavior diminishes the buyer’s capacity for empathy and reinforces a money-over-everything mindset, ultimately hindering the development of genuine intimate relationships.

These were the collective views presented by the AI.

I then scrutinized its arguments and identified several questionable premises, which formed the basis of my first round of rebuttals.

- **The analogy with manual labor:** Numerous workers engaged in high-risk physical labor do so out of necessity. If “no other choice” is the key factor, why is their labor considered legal?
- **The role of regulation:** If the primary source of sex workers’ psychological trauma (PTSD) is inappropriate treatment from clients, that very fact indicates that the problem lies in the lack of regulation. Why not establish a regulated management system to ensure an equitable transactional environment?
- **The uniqueness of sex:** This is the crux of my rebuttal. All of the AI's arguments seem to rest on an unspoken premise—that sex is inherently special and cannot be commoditized. I contend, however, that this very premise itself needs to be substantiated. Why?

At this juncture, our dialogue touched upon the first truly valuable core issue: the nature of sex. All subsequent discussions would revolve around this question.
