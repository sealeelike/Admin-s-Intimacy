# Admin's intimacy

Can human emotions be quantified? Can the boundaries of love and desire be defined by logic?

My exploration began with a specific question—legitimacy of "prostitution." I posed it to an AI, expecting a debate, but instead, I received a profound revelation. As our dialogue evolved, we co-constructed a peculiar "unified field theory": one that maps the entire world of human emotion onto the architecture of a computer system.

In this world, ambiguity disappears. Every behavior, every relationship, is given a precise definition. Sex is the `sudo` command set, possessing the highest privilege to access the kernel; love is the mutual entrustment of `Root` accounts; friendship consists of `trusted users` with specific advanced permissions. **Our discussions no longer revolve around "right and wrong," but rather "risk and cost," "configuration and compatibility," "vulnerabilities and patches."**

I discovered that when we detach from moral judgment and instead examine ourselves from the perspective of a system administrator, an unprecedented sense of clarity and control emerges. We are no longer slaves to our desires but engineers who can actively maintain, debug, and upgrade our own systems.

From the "difference between sex work and manual labor," to the "boundary between friendship and love," and even "how to face emotional temptations at work," this powerful model has cleared a path for us through the thorns.

I decided to document this intellectual adventure and share it with those who, like me, seek light in the fog of emotions. This book will reconstruct the thread of my dialogue with the AI, hoping that this unique mental toolkit can also bring you inspiration.
