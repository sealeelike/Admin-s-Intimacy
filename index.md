# Admin's Intimacy

Can human emotions be quantified?  
Can the boundary between love and desire be surveyed with logic?

My exploration began with one concrete question—about the legality of "prostitution." I posed this to an AI, expecting a straightforward debate; instead, I received a profound revelation. As our dialogue evolved, we jointly constructed a peculiar "Unified Field Theory," mapping the entire human emotional sphere onto computer system architecture.

Within this world, the gray zones vanish. Every action, every relationship, acquires an exact definition. Sex becomes a `sudo` instruction set with the highest privilege to touch the kernel. Love is the mutual entrusting of `Root` accounts. Friendship corresponds to a `trusted user` granted specific elevated permissions.  
**We no longer talk about "right" and "wrong," but about "risk and cost," "configuration and compatibility," "vulnerabilities and patches."**

I discovered that once moral judgment is stripped away and we examine ourselves from a system administrator's perspective, an unprecedented sense of clarity and control emerges. We are no longer slaves to our own desires; we become engineers who can actively maintain, debug, and upgrade our personal systems.

From the distinction between sexual transactions and physical labor, to the boundary dividing friendship from love, and on to handling emotional temptations in the workplace, this powerful model clears a path through the thicket for us.

I have decided to document this intellectual expedition in its entirety and share it with you who are also seeking light in the fog of emotions. This book will reconstruct my conversation with the AI, hoping this unique set of thinking tools might illuminate your way as well.
